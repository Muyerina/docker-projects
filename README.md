# docker-projects
Docker projects for learning purposes

In this repository I will include different projects that help me understand and work with docker. 


## first-container
Basic project from *Pluralsight course* [**Getting Started with Docker**](https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/37092a4b-64af-429f-ac0e-c30ace526653/table-of-contents), by [Nigel Poulton](https://github.com/nigelpoulton). Its a simple web application to run with Docker and see how can you build, push and run applications in a container.  
Instead of being so simple, I tried to personalice it to make it mine and take more control over the code.

The web app is made in **Express**, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, with handlebars view engine.

For more information see the [Wiki page](https://github.com/Muyerina/docker-projects/wiki/first-container).


## postgresql-scripts
In the *Pluralsight course* [**Spring Framework: Creating Your First Spring Boot Application**](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/creating-first-spring-boot-application/table-of-contents), by [Dan Bunker](https://github.com/dlbunker/) we had to create a Postgress container and execute some scripts to create tables and fill them with data. This process had been difficult for me while I was learning Docker, so once I discovered how can I do it, I decided to make an example in here.

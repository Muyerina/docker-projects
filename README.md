# docker-projects
Docker projects for learning purposes

In this repository I will include different projects that help me understand and work with docker. 


## first-container
------
Basic project from *Pluralsight course* [**Getting Started with Docker**](https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/37092a4b-64af-429f-ac0e-c30ace526653/table-of-contents), by [Nigel Poulton](https://github.com/nigelpoulton). Its a simple web application to run with Docker and see how can you build, push and run applications in a container.  
Instead of being so simple, I tried to personalice it to make it mine and take more control over the code.

The web app is made in Express, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, with handlebars view engine.
